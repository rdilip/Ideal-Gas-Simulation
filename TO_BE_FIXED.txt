PERIODIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
	a) Particles that move over boundary need to reppear on other side
	b) potential energy function needs to use the closest image within size/ 2

INPUT SWITCH STATEMENT TO TOGGLE MODE
NECESSARY MODES ARE 
-c create random simulation
-l load simulation from input textfile
-d debugging mode, prints out gas state each time it collects data 

Need to also accept number of simulations and interval at which to print simulation
